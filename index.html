            <h1>Part I: Prologue</h1>
            <p>Gyra was born August 3rd, 2015, to undefined parents in undefined location on August 3rd, 2015. She was born undefined pounds and undefined ounces.</p>
            <p>She was born with a brindle pattern, a white stripe on her nose, and each of her four feet were white.</p>

                <h1>Part II: Controversy</h1>
                <p>It is alleged that Gyra has personally claimed to be the tallest dog in existence. These claims seem to be nothing more than unfounded rumors.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, Snopes has dispelled the rumors in an official statement, saying:</p>
                <blockquote>We legitimately have zero idea what any of this is about. I guess some dude owns a dog and this dog thinks it's bigger than other dogs? Why are you calling me? Also stop recording me.</blockquote>

                    <p>A stunning display of length</p>
                </div>
                <p>It is not clear whether Gyra is standing on her back legs when taking measurements, but even then, there are dogs that are clearly taller than her, making this claim demonstrably false.</p>
